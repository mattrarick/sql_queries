# sql_queries

These are queries from a mysql course that I have been working through to refresh my sql skills and to familiarize myself with mysql which I had not used previously. Commands were used repeatedly and in varying order for challenges during the course. I commented out each previous query in the files so that I could source the file in the command line.
